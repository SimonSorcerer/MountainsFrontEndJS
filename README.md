# Mountains
My first try of **React.js** driven web page/application.
App displays a timeline with mountains (supposedly ascended by the user) and user can add/remove mountains to/from timeline.
App uses *Azure mobile services* for storing data and authentication (using *Facebook* oAuth).

Some pictures:
